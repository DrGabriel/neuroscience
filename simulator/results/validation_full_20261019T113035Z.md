### Claims (seeds in which the claim holds)

| ID | Statement | Kind | N = 302 | N = 1,000 | N = 10,000 | N = 100,000 | N = 1,000,000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Omission-fault and timing-fault agents both abolish quorum (Section 6.2) | test | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| C2 | Without reference feedback (lambda = 0) there is no hysteresis (Section 4.3) | consistency check | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| C3 | Hysteresis (neural inertia) grows with lambda; no recovery counts as unbounded (prediction 5) | consistency check | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| C4 | Reference feedback sharpens the loss-of-consciousness transition (prediction 1) | test | 19/20 (76–99%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| C5 | Hub lesions lower the loss concentration more than random lesions (prediction 6) | test | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| C6 | Reduced arousal delays emergence more than it shifts induction (Kelz et al., 2008) | test | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| C7 | Without the agent's action on arousal circuits, quorum is still lost but at a higher concentration (Moore et al., 2012; Eikermann et al., 2011) | consistency check | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| O2 | Trapped unconscious at zero concentration after hub lesion, lambda = 8.85 ms | test | 4/20 (8–42%) | 4/20 (8–42%) | 0/20 (0–16%) | 0/20 (0–16%) | 0/20 (0–16%) |
| O3 | Sleep with population-level down-states at the rat share (0.095) loses quorum | test | 0/20 (0–16%) | 0/20 (0–16%) | 0/20 (0–16%) | 0/20 (0–16%) | 0/20 (0–16%) |
| O4 | Sleep with population-level down-states at the human share (0.25) loses quorum | test | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| O5 | Sleep with one typical human slow wave silencing its measured share of regions (0.271) loses quorum (Nir et al., 2011) | test | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |

### Extension tests (seeds in which the pre-specified test passes; not part of the verdict)

| ID | Statement | Kind | N = 302 | N = 1,000 | N = 10,000 | N = 100,000 | N = 1,000,000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Sleep (no arousal, connection-level down-states, share 0.095, rat) has a wakeable stable unconscious state | test | 15/20 (53–89%) | 15/20 (53–89%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| E2 | Deeper sleep (connection-level down-states, share 0.25, human upper estimate) has a wakeable stable unconscious state | test | 18/20 (70–97%) | 17/20 (64–95%) | 18/20 (70–97%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
| E3 | Deep anaesthesia has only an unconscious state, so no perturbation restores quorum | test | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) | 20/20 (84–100%) |
